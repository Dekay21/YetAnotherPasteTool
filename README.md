# YetAnotherPasteTool

This plugin is used to create custom schematics and pasting them. It was made for personal use but everyone is allowed to use it.
The chance of this working with any other schematic tools is 0, so please don't try.

## Usage

Select an area you want to create a schematic out of with:

```/region set <1/2>``` Where 1 is the upper left corner and 2 is the bottom right corner

Then save the new schematics with:

```/sc save <name>```

### Note
Chest/Armor stand/item frame contents are not being saved

<hr/>

Pasting a created schematic works the same way, but just requires you to set the upper left corner with:

```/region set 1```

Then paste it with:

```/sc paste <name>```

<hr/>

Deleting a schematic is as simple as:

```/sc delete <name>```
